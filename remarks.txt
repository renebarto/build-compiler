General:

- buildroot does not update *.pc files which may lead to issues later on. So I've add this feature.
- When updating references in *.pc and *.la files, sometimes the staging directory is present. This also needs to be replaced. I've added install-functions which does the full backward and forward replacement.
- Since buildroot commit 2d0d94ef43377c94b6c74679ed65f95bb35f7b02 (2017-10-03), wpewebkit was bumped to eafdc7f08cfc5a4a256dcff0c1881784fa4341fe, which enforces usage of libepoxy. This will fail the build if we do not have that library. For now, we are going back to commit 5811a55428f6fa7631461002c65ed48ef86f44f8 (2017-09-25) which does not need libepoxy yet. But we need to fix that.

Running Weston:
- After building, the output is in output/target. The weston executable is therefore in output/target/usr/bin. Simply starting it will not work, you will have to set some variables:
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/weston or /run/user/1000
mkdir -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
chmod 700 $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
export LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=$BUILD_PREFIX/output/target/usr/lib/dri
If desired, update the  weston.ini file in $BUILD_PREFIX/output/target/etc/xdg
From output/target/usr/bin, run ./weston -c ../../etc/xdg/weston.ini

libpng-1.6.28

- Although LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD is defined correctly, libz.so cannot be found by configure Additionally specifying LDFLAGS="-L$staging_directory/usr/lib" works, but is in conflict with buildroot!
- Similarly, zlib.h is not found by build unless CPATH=$staging_directory/usr/include is specified.
- Need to also fix /usr/bin/libpng16-config and libpng-config for correct paths.

freetype-2.7.1

- Need to also fix /usr/bin/freetype-config for correct paths.

fontconfig-2.12.1

- Is mention as xutil_util-macros, but build later in buildroot, but is needed for libpciaccess.

libpciaccess-0.13.4

- Although LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD is defined correctly, libz.so cannot be found by configure Additionally specifying LDFLAGS="-L$staging_directory/usr/lib" works, but is in conflict with buildroot!
- Similarly, zlib.h is not found by build unless CPATH=$staging_directory/usr/include is specified, both for configure and make.

libpthread-stubs-0.3

-

libffi-3.2.1

- Needs auto-reconf, so added this as option to package.

ncurses-5.9

gst1-plugins-bad-1.10.4

- As gettextize is in a different directory, it is important to specify gettext_datadir=$staging_directory/usr/share/gettext when calling gettextize
- For the same reason , it is important to specify AUTOM4TE=/usr/bin/autom4te gettext_datadir=$staging_directory/usr/share/gettext when calling autoreconfigure.
